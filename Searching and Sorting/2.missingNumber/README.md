## ✨ Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all elements are unique and are in the range `[0, n]`. One number in that range is missing from the array. Your task is to find and return that missing number.

## 📘 Examples

### Example 1:
```txt
Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3, range = [0,3]. Missing number is 2.
```

### Example 2:
```txt
Input: nums = [0, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2, range = [0,2]. Missing number is 2.
```

### Example 3:
```txt
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9, range = [0,9]. Missing number is 8.
```

## ✅ Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁴`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All elements in `nums` are **unique**

## 🏁 Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
